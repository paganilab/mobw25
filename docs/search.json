    "section": "Differential Expression Analysis",
    "text": "Differential Expression Analysis\nThe main purpose of the steps we performed previously is to get to this point with a fair knowledge of the data at hand, all the steps have to be repeated each time one starts with some fresh new data (no data is the same!!). Now we can start performing differential expression analysis with the edgeR package. The main concept behind it is to contrast two categories of our interest in the data (i.e. CD8+ Tex vs CD8+ Trest) and check which genes are predominantly (defined in a statistical sense) expressed in one category as opposed to the other. As introduced previously, we tell edgeR which comparisons to perform through the design formula we specified above when we created our DGEList object dds. We can recap the design formula that we specified.\n\n# Check out the design formula we specified (do not copy this, you should have it in your variable `design`)\n~ Donor + SampleGroup\n\nWith that design formula we are telling the software that we are interested in checking for the gene expression differences happening between the categories present in the SampleGroup column of our samples table while simultaneously correcting for the possible uninteresting differences that can arise across different donors, whose information is stored in the Donor column of the samples table which we can check out below. The Donor therefore represents our batch whose effect we are trying to correct for.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Donor \n    SampleGroup \n  \n \n\n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204446 \n    HD276 \n    Trest \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204447 \n    HD276 \n    Ttumor \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204448 \n    HD276 \n    Teff \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204449 \n    HD276 \n    Tex \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204450 \n    HD280 \n    Trest \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204451 \n    HD280 \n    Ttumor \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe categories are exactly the ones we have been plotting all along up to this point (the different CD8+ T-cell types).\n\n💡 Given that we have four differences categories (these are also called levels in R) in our SampleGroup column (which can also be called a factor in R), edgeR could perform different comparisons since these are pairwise. We need to keep in mind that our reference values are referred to the CD8+ Teff group!\n\n\nThe Main edgeR Function\nLet’s perform differential expression analysis with edgeR on our dataset using the main function for the task in the package, glmTest(). Without going into the mathematical details, this function fits a generalized linear model (GLM) to the data in order to perform inference and decide which genes are statistically up- or down-regulated. We first need to compute gene-wise dispersion estimate with the function estimateDisp(). These are needed by the model in order for its underlying assumptions to hold true. We can visually inspect the fit of the dispersion estimates below.\n\n# First we fit gene-wise dispersion estimates to accomodate the theoretical assumptions of the model\ndds <- estimateDisp(dds, design, robust=TRUE)\n\n# Plot the fitted dispersion values\nplotBCV(dds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the dispersion estimate we can see that we are capturing and modelling efficiently the gene-wise dispersion in the dataset which is intrinsically present due to variation. This variation is quantified in edgeR with a BCV or a Biological Coefficient of Variation which takes into account both unwanted biological variability (specified in the design) and technical variation.\n\n# Fit the GLM\nfit <- glmFit(dds, design)\n\n# Perform differential expression testing given the design formula we wrote previously\nlrt <- glmLRT(fit, coef=7)\n\nNotice how we did not use the transformed version of the dataset (log2dds) but we started from the object dds. As previously mentioned, the package needs to start from raw count data to correctly assess differences in gene expression.\nLet’s say that we are very interested in the differences occurring between CD8+ Tex and CD8+ Teff cells. The reason why we specified coef=7 in the code above is explained by how edgeR interprets the design matrix that we built previously, which specifies the kinds of comparison to make. If we take a look at it we can see how the 7th column is the one related to the Tex group, the one we want to compare against our reference group Teff.\n\nhead(design, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    (Intercept) \n    donorHD280 \n    donorHD286 \n    donorHD287 \n    sample_groupTrest \n    sample_groupTtumor \n    sample_groupTex \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 In GLMs, design matrices are built to communicate the way we want to model samples when testing for gene expression differences. Some packages keep this aspect less exposed than other to allow users which are less familiar with the mathematical concepts to still use the package. Often, better knowledge allows better control and flexibility over what we do, at the cost of greater responsibility!\n\n\n\nExploring Results\nAfter having used the main edgeR function, we can actively explore the results of the analysis for the comparisons of our interest. For example we might want to check if any gene is up-regulated during the process of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. We can later filter the results based adjusted P-value used to accept or reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_{0}\\)) of a gene NOT being differentially expressed between the two conditions.\nWith the code below we can extract a table that we call res which contains the results for every single gene, stored in separate rows.\n\n# Extract the results\nres <- as.data.frame(lrt$table)\n\nWe can now check out our results object, which will be a data.frame, a table.\n\n# Check out results object\nhead(res, 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    logFC \n    logCPM \n    LR \n    PValue \n  \n \n\n  \n    ENSG00000182888 \n    -0.7030535 \n    -0.9936256 \n    4.2525633 \n    0.0391911 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000286431 \n    1.5461179 \n    -0.1530747 \n    11.8110610 \n    0.0005888 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101846 \n    0.2581339 \n    1.7994127 \n    1.9918449 \n    0.1581481 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000285679 \n    0.0118590 \n    -1.7883345 \n    0.0007381 \n    0.9783257 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101849 \n    0.1295766 \n    6.2607280 \n    1.2854701 \n    0.2568844 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000047644 \n    0.4654929 \n    6.7504933 \n    14.5868099 \n    0.0001338 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000004961 \n    -0.6228863 \n    3.7283726 \n    23.4757372 \n    0.0000013 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000005302 \n    1.0203073 \n    6.7934565 \n    67.0298287 \n    0.0000000 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101911 \n    -0.8501682 \n    4.8448978 \n    55.9050804 \n    0.0000000 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000229083 \n    -1.4635875 \n    0.8512208 \n    10.3340205 \n    0.0013060 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can additionally print out a summary of the results of the differential analysis at a P-value < 0.05 by using the following code:\n\nsummary(decideTests(lrt))\n\n       sample_groupTex\nDown              7046\nNotSig            8714\nUp                6923\n\n\nIn here we can see the type of comparison we are performing (vs the reference, in our case CD8+ Teff cells), the P-value threshold we used and the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes at varying log-fold change levels, keep in mind that a log-fold change of 1 corresponds to a difference in raw gene expression value of 2 times since the log has a base of 2. So, to recap, all of the genes with log-fold change of 1 or more are twice as expressed in one condition compared to the other and we will later filter genes based on the fold-change value.\n\n\nSaving Results\nLet’s save the results object we just generated in a .csv file. We can then source it back and load it into the session using the code we have seen at the end of the first day of the workshop.\n\n# Save the results object\nwrite.table(res, \"results.csv\", sep=\",\", quote = F)\n\nIn the code below, we will create two new tables with the genes that were up-regulated and down-regulated in the comparison we performed, we will use these later.\n\n# Extract the information related to up-regulated and down-regulated genes\nup_df <- res %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(PValue < 0.05 & logFC > 1)\ndown_df <- res %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(PValue < 0.05 & logFC < -1)\n\nIf we check the table with the up-regulated genes we can see it has the following structure (we just took some specific rows - genes - of the complete results table corresponding to up-regulated genes):\n\nhead(up_df, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    logFC \n    logCPM \n    LR \n    PValue \n  \n \n\n  \n    ENSG00000286431 \n    1.546118 \n    -0.1530747 \n    11.811061 \n    0.0005888 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000005302 \n    1.020307 \n    6.7934565 \n    67.029829 \n    0.0000000 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000176896 \n    1.483553 \n    2.7280733 \n    49.397968 \n    0.0000000 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000289449 \n    1.587543 \n    -1.3504361 \n    6.001932 \n    0.0142902 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 How would you check if the dimensions of the tables we extracted correspond to the number of differentially expressed genes present in the summary we printed above? (hint: go back and look at how we checked for the number of rows and columns in a table)\n\n\n\nVisualizing Results With MD Plots\nMD plots are used to get a sense of the proportions of up- and down-regulated genes between two conditions and the number of counts per million (CPM) of each gene, to check if genes with higher counts are statistically preferred to be also differential.\n\n# Plot the MD Plot\nplotMD(lrt)\nabline(h=c(-1, 1), col=\"gray\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the gray line we indicate a fold-change of +/- 1 which, if you recall, stands for an actual magnitude of change of value 2.\n\n\nVisualizing Results With Volcano Plots\nOnce we have our results from the comparison, we might want to present them graphically to aid their interpretation by other people or to emphasize messages of interest within them (like the statistics only for some genes of interest). One way to visualize results from a differential expression analysis is to draw a volcano plot. The goal of a volcano plot is to display and summarize the main metrics of output from a differential expression analysis, these consist of P-values and log-fold changes associated with each gene in the dataset for the specific comparison we are performing (Tex vs Teff in our case). These two variables can be plotted together to get a feel for the overall results in the analysis. Let’s plot a volcano summarizing the results of the comparison we have performed.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Set the threshold just for visualization!\nlog2FC_val = 1\npadj_val = 0.05\n\n# Create a table with gene information\nvolcano_corr = as.data.frame(res) %>% mutate(names=rownames(res)) %>% drop_na()\n\n# Create a separate column in the table with the information needed to color point in three categories\nvolcano_corr$threshold=ifelse(volcano_corr$logFC >= log2FC_val & volcano_corr$PValue < padj_val,\"A\",\n                         ifelse(volcano_corr$logFC <= -log2FC_val & volcano_corr$PValue < padj_val, \"B\",\"C\"))\n\n# Plot!\nggplot(volcano_corr, aes(x=logFC, y =-log10(PValue), color=threshold)) +\n    geom_point(alpha=0.9, size=3) +\n    scale_color_manual(values=c( \"B\"=\"#3891A6\",\"A\"=\"#C52233\", \"C\"=\"grey\")) + \n    xlab(\"log2(Fold Change)\") + ylab(\"-log10(adj p-value)\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_vline(xintercept=0, color='black') +\n    geom_hline(yintercept=0, color='black') +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\", axis.title.x = element_text(size = 17),\n                axis.text.y=element_text(size = 0),\n                axis.text.x=element_text(size = 17),\n               axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping IDs to Gene Symbols\nThe volcano plot above is nice but it is not so informative since we cannot see any gene name!

We can fix this by converting between the two, this can be achieved in R through dedicated packages like org.Hs.eg.db which map between the two types of gene identifiers. Let’s do it using the code below.\n\n# Use the package for the conversion between Ensembl IDs and Gene Symbols\nlibrary(org.Hs.eg.db)\n\nvolcano_corr$gene_names <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=row.names(volcano_corr), column=\"SYMBOL\", keytype=\"ENSEMBL\", multiVals=\"first\")\n\nWe can check that we now have new mapped gene symbols that we can use to make our volcano plot informative!\n\nvolcano_corr$gene_names[1:40] \n\n [1] \"RPS27AP20\"    NA             \"STS\"          NA             \"TBL1X\"       \n [6] \"WWC3\"         \"HCCS\"         \"MSL3\"         \"PRPS2\"        NA            \n[11] \"TMSB4X\"       NA             \"LINC01203\"    \"EGFL6\"        \"TCEANC\"      \n[16] \"RAB9A\"        \"OFD1\"         NA             NA             \"MOSPD2\"      \n[21] \"CA5BP1\"       \"CA5B\"         \"ZRSR2\"        NA             \"SYAP1\"       \n[26] \"TXLNG\"        \"NHS\"          \"SCML1\"        \"CDKL5\"        NA            \n[31] \"LOC101928415\" \"PDHA1\"        \"CNKSR2\"       \"MBTPS2\"       \"YY2\"         \n[36] \"SMS\"          \"PHEX\"         NA             \"PRDX4\"        \"SAT1\"        \n\n\nAnd finally we can try to plot again our volcano with the addition of gene names!\n\n\nShow code\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nvolcano_corr <- volcano_corr[order(volcano_corr$PValue, decreasing = FALSE),] %>% drop_na()\n\nnames_list <- c(volcano_corr$gene_names[1:10], \"TOX\", \"ENTPD1\", \"HAVCR2\")\n\nneg_fc <- volcano_corr[order(volcano_corr$logFC, decreasing = TRUE),] %>% filter(PValue < 0.05 ) %>% .$gene_names %>% head(10) # Change these numbers to avoid overcrowding in the plot\npos_fc <- volcano_corr[order(volcano_corr$logFC, decreasing = FALSE),] %>% filter(PValue < 0.05) %>% .$gene_names %>% head(10)\n\nnames_list <- c(names_list, neg_fc, pos_fc)\n  \nvolcano_corr <- volcano_corr %>% mutate(., stroke = ifelse(.$gene_names %in% names_list & volcano_corr$PValue < padj_val & volcano_corr$logFC > log2FC_val, 2, 0), \n                                               names=ifelse(.$gene_names %in% names_list,'mark','leave')) %>%\n                                                    .[order(.$names),]\n\nggplot(volcano_corr, aes(x=logFC, y =-log10(PValue), color=threshold)) +\n    geom_point(alpha=0.9, size=3) +\n    scale_color_manual(values=c( \"B\"=\"#3891A6\",\"A\"=\"#C52233\", \"C\"=\"grey\")) + \n    xlab(\"log2(Fold Change)\") + ylab(\"-log10(adj p-value)\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_vline(xintercept=0, color='black') +\n    geom_hline(yintercept=0, color='black') +\n    theme(legend.position=\"none\", axis.title.x = element_text(size = 17),\n                axis.text.y=element_text(size = 0),\n                axis.text.x=element_text(size = 17),\n               axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15)) +\n    geom_label_repel(data=volcano_corr[which(volcano_corr$names=='mark' & volcano_corr$threshold=='A'),], aes(label=gene_names), max.overlaps = 30, color='black', size=4, fill='white', fontface='italic') +\n    geom_label_repel(data=volcano_corr[which(volcano_corr$names=='mark' & volcano_corr$threshold=='B'),], aes(label=gene_names), max.overlaps = 30, color='black', size=4, fill='white', fontface='italic')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Results With Heatmaps\nWe can also plot differentially expressed genes in the two conditions of our interest using heatmaps.

As we will see, there are further downstream analyses we can perform to get a sense of trends and pathways activated in the cell type of our interest. These analyses which look at genes in groups or ontologies try to match conditions with functions, to better elucidate what is going on inside cells in a specific condition."

    "text": "Further Downstream Analyses\nOnce we have our differentially expressed genes, we can perform various downstream analyses to check the functional aspects of the group of genes which are up- or down-regulated in our condition of interest. In the following sections, we will go through two of these, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GO).\n\nGSEA\nGene Set Enrichment Analaysis was first published in 2005 as a method to interpret genome-wide expression profiles from RNA-seq data using sets of genes with known biological functions. In this sense, GSEA is used to check at which level a signature of genes is enriched in an expression profile. We can graphically summarize the steps in GSEA using the following picture, from the original publication.\n\n\nGSEA needs two ingredients, a ranked gene list from our analysis (for instance genes ordered by log-fold change) and a list of genes with biological relevance (for instance genes known to regulate CD8+ T-cell exhaustion).\n\n1. We start by taking our list of up- or down- regulated genes and order them based on the value of their fold-change so that our list will have genes that change a lot positively at the top and ones that change a lot negatively at the bottom. This will represent our ranking.\n2. We then take one or more curated and archived gene sets which are related to a biological function we might be interested in investigating in our dataset.\n3. Finally we go through our ranking from top to bottom counting the number of times we see a gene which is also in the gene set that we are looking at. We expect to see genes from a given gene set appear at the top of our ranking if that biological function is particularly important in the genes of our ranking.\nOver the years, a collection of curated gene sets called MSigDB has been expanded and is now a great resource to check which ones are more or less enriched in our data at hand.\n\n\nThe web interface for the MSigDB gene set database\n\nIn our specific use case, we are going to run GSEA on the set of up-regulated genes in CD8+ Tex cells to check if a gene set of exhaustion is indeed enriched in the genes we have found up-regulated. For this task we are going to use the fgsea package. In order to extract the gene set without the need to directly download it, we are going to access MSigDB directly from R using another package called msigdbr.\n\n🚨 WARNING: This code that follows might kill your R session inadvertedly. If this happens, don’t panic, and reload the object we saved before! Use the following syntax to get back on track after you resume the session:\n res <- read.table(\"results.csv\", sep = \",\")\n samples <- read.table(\"samples_table.csv\", sep = \",\")\nIn this way you should be all set to successfully run all the code below! 🙌🏻\n\n\nExtract MSigDB Signatures\nIn the following chunk, we use a function from the msigdbr package to extract the gene set of our interest:\n\nlibrary(msigdbr)\n\n# Extract the gene sets from the MSigDB database\nimmune_gsets <- msigdbr(species = \"human\", category = \"C7\", subcategory = \"IMMUNESIGDB\")\n\nLet’s see what’s in the immune_gsets object:\n\n# Take a look at what we fetched from the database\nhead(immune_gsets, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    gs_cat \n    gs_subcat \n    gs_name \n    gene_symbol \n    entrez_gene \n    ensembl_gene \n    human_gene_symbol \n    human_entrez_gene \n    human_ensembl_gene \n    gs_id \n    gs_pmid \n    gs_geoid \n    gs_exact_source \n    gs_url \n    gs_description \n  \n \n\n  \n    C7 \n    IMMUNESIGDB \n    GOLDRATH_EFF_VS_MEMORY_CD8_TCELL_DN \n    ABCA2 \n    20 \n    ENSG00000107331 \n    ABCA2 \n    20 \n    ENSG00000107331 \n    M3044 \n    16492737 \n     \n    GSE1000002_1582_200_DN \n     \n    Genes down-regulated in comparison of effector CD8 T cells versus memory CD8 T cells. \n  \n  \n    C7 \n    IMMUNESIGDB \n    GOLDRATH_EFF_VS_MEMORY_CD8_TCELL_DN \n    ABCC5 \n    10057 \n    ENSG00000114770 \n    ABCC5 \n    10057 \n    ENSG00000114770 \n    M3044 \n    16492737 \n     \n    GSE1000002_1582_200_DN \n     \n    Genes down-regulated in comparison of effector CD8 T cells versus memory CD8 T cells. \n  \n  \n    C7 \n    IMMUNESIGDB \n    GOLDRATH_EFF_VS_MEMORY_CD8_TCELL_DN \n    ABHD14A \n    25864 \n    ENSG00000248487 \n    ABHD14A \n    25864 \n    ENSG00000248487 \n    M3044 \n    16492737 \n     \n    GSE1000002_1582_200_DN \n     \n    Genes down-regulated in comparison of effector CD8 T cells versus memory CD8 T cells. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that every row is a different gene (the gene_symbol colums) with its associated gene set (gs_name column). We will now extract a gene set related to CD8+ T-cell exhaustion which comes from this publication and is names GSE9650_EFFECTOR_VS_EXHAUSTED_CD8_TCELL_DN in the database.\n\n# Filter the `immune_gsets` table and take only the genes from the gene set of our interest\ngene_set_name <- \"GSE9650_EFFECTOR_VS_EXHAUSTED_CD8_TCELL_DN\"\ntex_sig_df <- immune_gsets %>% filter(gs_name == gene_set_name)\n\nHow many genes do we have in the gene set that we just isolated? We can check this by looking at the number of rows of this new tex_sig_df table that we generated above using the command nrow(tex_sig_df). Doing this should result in having 232 genes.\n\n\nPerform GSEA\nNow we can perform GSEA using the fgsea package in R!\n\nlibrary(fgsea)\n\n# Prepare the ranking based on fold-change, from high (expressed in Tex) to low (expressed in Teff)\nids <- res %>% arrange(desc(logFC)) %>% rownames()\nvals <- res %>% arrange(desc(logFC)) %>% pull(logFC)\n\n# Set names\nnames(vals) <- ids \n\n# Prepare gene set\ngset <- list(tex_sig_df$ensembl_gene)\nnames(gset) <- gene_set_name\n\n# Run GSEA\nfgseaRes <- fgsea(pathways = gset, \n                  stats    = vals,\n                  eps      = 0.0)\n\n\n# Take a look at results\nfgseaRes\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    pathway \n    pval \n    padj \n    log2err \n    ES \n    NES \n    size \n    leadingEdge \n  \n \n\n  \n    GSE9650_EFFECTOR_VS_EXHAUSTED_CD8_TCELL_DN \n    0.0001384 \n    0.0001384 \n    0.5188481 \n    -0.4233808 \n    -1.759765 \n    144 \n    ENSG00000205002, ENSG00000143333, ENSG00000115008, ENSG00000164251, ENSG00000151012, ENSG00000198369, ENSG00000100285, ENSG00000122877, ENSG00000186827, ENSG00000172301, ENSG00000168209, ENSG00000049249, ENSG00000134202, ENSG00000067208, ENSG00000122378, ENSG00000162692, ENSG00000144935, ENSG00000139318, ENSG00000022267, ENSG00000005189, ENSG00000183814, ENSG00000186187, ENSG00000153234, ENSG00000174500, ENSG00000178695, ENSG00000147383, ENSG00000120699, ENSG00000132326, ENSG00000126778, ENSG00000174307, ENSG00000142453, ENSG00000148834, ENSG00000111142, ENSG00000177425, ENSG00000162775, ENSG00000181019, ENSG00000174437, ENSG00000122140, ENSG00000000971, ENSG00000117595, ENSG00000106546, ENSG00000168298, ENSG00000132305, ENSG00000241468, ENSG00000196388, ENSG00000100473, ENSG00000128791 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now plot the GSEA results in the standard way:\n\n# Plot GSEA results\nplotEnrichment(gset[[gene_set_name]],\n               vals) + labs(title=gene_set_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the GSEA results, we can see that the current gene set we used is mostly depleted in the differential genes we have in our CD8+ Tex vs CD8+ Teff comparison. Given that the gene set comes from a study carried out in mice in a context of chronic viral infection, this might indicate that our current results reflect a different kind of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion observed in the tumor microenvironment of human tumors as opposed to the process happening during viral infection in mice.\n\n💡 Whenever we use gene sets when testing for enrichment, we have to be sure of where they were isolated in order to avoid misinterpreting results and/or getting to wrong conclusions, like it could have happened in this case!\n\n\n\n\nGene Ontology Enrichment Analysis\nNext, we will try to get a more unsupervised look at what kind of biology is happening inside our CD8+ Tex cells by performing a Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis. This will allow us to check which and how many up-regulated genes in CD8+ Tex cells are represented in various biological processes. We will do this using the clusterProfiler package in R.\n\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\n\n# Get up-regulated genes\ngenes <- rownames(up_df)\n\n# Perform gene ontology enrichment\nego <- enrichGO(gene         = genes,\n                OrgDb         = org.Hs.eg.db,\n                keyType       = 'ENSEMBL',\n                ont           = \"MF\", # Molecular Function, use \"BP\" or \"CC\" for Biological Process or Cellular Component\n                pAdjustMethod = \"BH\",\n                pvalueCutoff  = 0.05,\n                qvalueCutoff  = 0.05,\n                readable      = TRUE)\n\n\nhead(ego)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    ID \n    Description \n    GeneRatio \n    BgRatio \n    pvalue \n    p.adjust \n    qvalue \n    geneID \n    Count \n  \n \n\n  \n    GO:0019957 \n    GO:0019957 \n    C-C chemokine binding \n    10/1394 \n    24/20616 \n    1.60e-06 \n    0.0012476 \n    0.0011809 \n    CXCR3/CCR8/CXCR6/CCR3/CCR2/CCR5/CX3CR1/XCR1/CXCR1/ZFP36 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    GO:0001637 \n    GO:0001637 \n    G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor activity \n    10/1394 \n    26/20616 \n    3.80e-06 \n    0.0012476 \n    0.0011809 \n    CXCR3/CCR8/CXCR6/CCR3/CCR2/CCR5/CX3CR1/XCR1/CMKLR1/CXCR1 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    GO:0004950 \n    GO:0004950 \n    chemokine receptor activity \n    10/1394 \n    26/20616 \n    3.80e-06 \n    0.0012476 \n    0.0011809 \n    CXCR3/CCR8/CXCR6/CCR3/CCR2/CCR5/CX3CR1/XCR1/CMKLR1/CXCR1 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    GO:0019956 \n    GO:0019956 \n    chemokine binding \n    11/1394 \n    33/20616 \n    6.30e-06 \n    0.0015561 \n    0.0014729 \n    CXCR3/CCR8/CXCR6/CCR3/CCR2/CCR5/CX3CR1/XCR1/ITGA4/CXCR1/ZFP36 \n    11 \n  \n  \n    GO:0016493 \n    GO:0016493 \n    C-C chemokine receptor activity \n    9/1394 \n    23/20616 \n    9.90e-06 \n    0.0019595 \n    0.0018547 \n    CXCR3/CCR8/CXCR6/CCR3/CCR2/CCR5/CX3CR1/XCR1/CXCR1 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    GO:0140326 \n    GO:0140326 \n    ATPase-coupled intramembrane lipid transporter activity \n    6/1394 \n    11/20616 \n    3.25e-05 \n    0.0053729 \n    0.0050856 \n    ABCB4/ABCB1/ABCA7/ABCA1/ABCA2/ATP8A2 \n    6 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now plot the enrichment values that we got with a graph layout.\n\n# Plot results of gene ontology enrichment\ngoplot(ego, firstSigNodes=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can also plot the results with what is known as a ranked dot plot, here we encode the significance of the enrichment in the color of the dot, while its size represent the overlap of the specific gene set with the one we are using to perform the test (our list of up-regulated genes).\n\ndotplot(ego, showCategory=20) + ggtitle(\"Dotplot for GO enrichment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 GO analyses might highlight very interesting patterns and generate hypotheses, but are many times quite hard to interpret depending also on the biological system we are studying.\n\n\n\nTake-home Messages 🏠\nCongratulations!

    "text": "Why Do We Need It?\nNormalization is the process by which we try to conform count data to make it comparable across samples and even across different genes. This is done to ensure that all of the uninteresting differences between genes are minimized in favor of the interesting biological differences that we want to highlight.\nThe main factors to take into account when normalizing data are:\n\nSequencing Depth:\n\n\n\nDifferences in sequencing depth (total number of reads in a sample) can cause genes to appear differentially expressed just due to technical reasons.\n\n\nGene Length:\n\n\n\nDifferences in gene length means that longer genes are prone to have more reads coming from them, therefore we need to normalize also for this aspect while processing data.\n\n\nRNA Composition:\n\n\n\nDifferences in RNA composition are also causative of technical artefacts which can skew the analyses. Differences in the number of genes expressed between samples and the number of differentially expressed gene across samples can greatly and negatively impact normalization methods. In the example, the majority of counts for sample A is related to the DE gene and therefore this might cause other genes to be normalized by this high number of counts, resulting in them appearing to be expressed at a lower level as opposed to the same genes in sample B."

    "text": "Introduction\nOne of the main interests behind performing a bulk RNA experiment is understanding which genes are more or less expressed across a set of conditions of interest, so we will compare gene expression levels and statistically assess and quantify differences arising between the conditions represented by our categories of samples. In this section we will start getting a feel for what the edgeR package is and how to use it to perform normalization and differential expression analysis on our bulk RNA seq data.\n\n💡 Detailed explanations of the statistical procedures implemented in the package are available in the package’s vignette.\n\nWe will start by loading the package that we installed in yesterday’s initial “setup” section:\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(edgeR)\n\nThe package contains many functions which are very helpful when dealing with tables of count data, we can inspect them all by typing the following command:\n\n# This should open a popup window in the lower right part of the screen displaying the functions in the package\n??edgeR\n\nIn the sections below, we will follow the standard analysis workflow suggested by the edgeR developers."

    "section": "Create a DGEList object",
    "text": "Create a DGEList object\nIn order for the package to read and understand our data and correctly perform the analysis, we need to organize our data in a way that the functions of the package can handle. This new object that we are going to create is called DGEList and there is a utility function to create one starting from the ingredients we currently have, (1) a table of counts (our counts object), (2) a table with sample information (our samples object). and (3) one last thing that we need to decide in order tell the package what comparisons we value the most, this is called a design formula.\n\nBehind The Design Formula\nThe design formula should contain the name of a column of interest in our table of samples which stores the information related to the levels (or categories) we want to contrast. Let’s say that we have a dataset with two conditions (condition_1 vs condition_2) that we want to compare. The samples table will look like this, with three replicates for each of the two conditions:\n\n\n\nSample Code\nPatient\nCondition\n\n\n\n\nSA1\nPt1\nCondition_1\n\n\nSA2\nPt2\nCondition_1\n\n\nSA3\nPt3\nCondition_1\n\n\nSA4\nPt1\nCondition_2\n\n\nSA5\nPt2\nCondition_2\n\n\nSA6\nPt3\nCondition_2\n\n\n\n\nPaired Analyses\nThe optimal setting for the analysis (decided experimentally) is to have paired samples. This might be a somewhat difficult concept to grasp, but for our table above this means that every Patient contributes equally to the two categories in the Condition columns that we are interested in. In this setting, we are fully capable of exploiting the statistics behind the tools we use for differential analysis by correcting for the uninteresting differences arising between patients. This aspect greatly helps the analysis and improves the statistical validity of the results.\n\n💡 Remember, this is something achieved by deciding the experimental setting beforehand! Ideally this should be done through a collaborative effort between bioinformaticians/statisticians and bench scientists!\n\n\nIf we are interested in performing a differential expression analysis comparing condition_1 versus condition_2, then our design formula should specify the Condition column.\n\n💡 What is the column that we are interested in when specifying the design formula using in our samples table?\n\nNow that we also understand the design formula, we can create the DGEList object with the data that we loaded beforehand, but first we need to check that the columns of the counts table are in the same order of the rows of the sample table, this is important since we want to be sure that the right levels of expression are associated to the right sample.\n\nall(rownames(samples) == colnames(counts))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNow that we are sure about this aspect we can actually build the object:\n\n# Create a design formula\ndonor <- samples$Donor\nsample_group <- factor(samples$SampleGroup, levels=c(\"Teff\",\"Trest\",\"Ttumor\",\"Tex\")) # Teff becomes our \"control\" group to which we compare the others\n\ndesign <- model.matrix(~ donor + sample_group)\n\n# Create a `DGEList` object and call it dds\ndds <- DGEList(counts = counts, \n                samples = samples \n                    )\n\n# Let's save the `design` in the dds object (remeber that `dds` is just a list in R which can be updated with different elements)\ndds$design <- design\n\nWe can now remove the counts table from our R environment since that information is stored in our DGEList object now. This is useful to save on memory space!\n\n# Remove original `counts` table to save memory space\nrm(counts)\ngc()\n\nGreat! You have created a DGEList object which we called dds, this contains all the information related to the counts table and the sample information table in one spot. We can have a look at the sample information table and the counts table in the dds object like so:\n\n# Look at the table with sample information\nhead(dds$samples)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    group \n    lib.size \n    norm.factors \n    Donor \n    SampleGroup \n    sex \n  \n \n\n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204446 \n    1 \n    40969678 \n    1 \n    HD276 \n    Trest \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204447 \n    1 \n    38734896 \n    1 \n    HD276 \n    Ttumor \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204448 \n    1 \n    57149808 \n    1 \n    HD276 \n    Teff \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204449 \n    1 \n    45415276 \n    1 \n    HD276 \n    Tex \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204450 \n    1 \n    51767738 \n    1 \n    HD280 \n    Trest \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204451 \n    1 \n    49277273 \n    1 \n    HD280 \n    Ttumor \n    Male \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that some new columns were added to the samples table present in our DGEList object when we created it (the group, lib.size, norm.factors columns)! These will be used by edgeR later on for data normalization!\nWe can also take a look at the table containing the counts, which is just another element of our DGEList object:\n\n# Look at the table with count information\nhead(dds$counts)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    BSSE_QGF_204446 \n    BSSE_QGF_204447 \n    BSSE_QGF_204448 \n    BSSE_QGF_204449 \n    BSSE_QGF_204450 \n    BSSE_QGF_204451 \n    BSSE_QGF_204452 \n    BSSE_QGF_204453 \n    BSSE_QGF_204458 \n    BSSE_QGF_204459 \n    BSSE_QGF_204460 \n    BSSE_QGF_204461 \n    BSSE_QGF_204462 \n    BSSE_QGF_204463 \n    BSSE_QGF_204464 \n    BSSE_QGF_204465 \n  \n \n\n  \n    ENSG00000228572 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000182378 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000226179 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000281849 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000280767 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000185960 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0"

Our dds object is indeed a list made up of three elements, the counts table, the samples table and the design table, these are accessible using $ like we did above.\n\nNow we can start removing some genes which are expressed at low levels. This action is justified both from the biological and the statistical points of view. Biologically, lowly expressed genes are less interesting while statistically, they do not provide enough sampling power to confidently test them for differential expression. In the following chunk we filter our dds object by keeping only genes (rows) which have at least 10 detected counts in each sample using the filterByExpr() function in the edgeR package.\n\n# Select which genes to keep\nkeep <- filterByExpr(dds, design)\n\n# Filter\ndds <- dds[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]\n\n\n💡 This is somewhat of an “easy” filtering strategy, there are many more complex ones available but sometimes it’s best to keep things simple!\n\nLet’s check how many genes we’re left with after filtering:\n\ndim(dds$counts)\n\n[1] 22683    16\n\n\nYou can see that we have cut the number of genes in our dataset by more than half, now we have 22683 remaining genes."

    "text": "Normalizing Count Data\nAs we have discussed above, normalization is an integral step to the downstream analysis of bulk RNA-seq data. In this section we will normalize our data using the calcNormFactors function of the package. As we have previously introduced, edgeR uses the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method to calculate a set of size factors to minimize the log-fold change differences occurring between samples (uninteresting) for the majority of genes. The counts for each sample get then multiplied by the scaling factors to generate what is referred to as effective library size, which will be used for all downstream analyses.\n\n# Call the function to normalize count data\ndds <- calcNormFactors(dds)\n\nWe can check the values of the computed size factors by doing the following, note how there are as many size factors as there are samples and they are inserted in a column of the samples table named norm.factors in our DGEList object:\n\ndds$samples\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    group \n    lib.size \n    norm.factors \n    Donor \n    SampleGroup \n    sex \n  \n \n\n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204446 \n    1 \n    40949757 \n    1.0306089 \n    HD276 \n    Trest \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204447 \n    1 \n    38716755 \n    0.9957071 \n    HD276 \n    Ttumor \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204448 \n    1 \n    57115716 \n    0.9261344 \n    HD276 \n    Teff \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204449 \n    1 \n    45387259 \n    1.0424493 \n    HD276 \n    Tex \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204450 \n    1 \n    51743863 \n    1.0199158 \n    HD280 \n    Trest \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204451 \n    1 \n    49255461 \n    0.9724292 \n    HD280 \n    Ttumor \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204452 \n    1 \n    50025518 \n    0.9978416 \n    HD280 \n    Teff \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204453 \n    1 \n    47946651 \n    1.0157618 \n    HD280 \n    Tex \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204458 \n    1 \n    39620524 \n    1.0178698 \n    HD286 \n    Trest \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204459 \n    1 \n    39543464 \n    1.0039252 \n    HD286 \n    Ttumor \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204460 \n    1 \n    36004615 \n    0.9694099 \n    HD286 \n    Teff \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204461 \n    1 \n    36042139 \n    1.0006105 \n    HD286 \n    Tex \n    Male \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204462 \n    1 \n    40382246 \n    1.0352586 \n    HD287 \n    Trest \n    Female \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204463 \n    1 \n    48326105 \n    0.9682855 \n    HD287 \n    Ttumor \n    Female \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204464 \n    1 \n    52039214 \n    0.9942164 \n    HD287 \n    Teff \n    Female \n  \n  \n    BSSE_QGF_204465 \n    1 \n    44687575 \n    1.0164136 \n    HD287 \n    Tex \n    Female \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 NOTE: Although edgeR does not use normalized counts as input (the normalization process happens inside automatically), the normalized counts we just generated are definitely useful when plotting results and performing clustering."

    "text": "Transforming Count Data\nAfter we have normalized our data, we need to perform a transformation. There are many ways to transform count data but all of them achieve the goal of removing the gene-wise dependence between variance and mean of expression values across samples (something called homoscedasticity) in order to highlight interesting and biologically relevant expression trends even for genes expressed at lower values. We transform the data using a function provided in the edgeR package called cpm() which also performs a logarithmic transformation which has the effect of reshaping the data to achieve gene-wise distributions which resemble a normal distribution. Without getting too much into the details of the workings of the function, we will transform the data and then look at how the gene-wise relationship between the mean and variance in our normalized data changes before and after the transformation. The purpose of this procedure is to allow proper data visualization later in the analysis, the transformed data is NOT used for the differential expression analysis which instead starts from raw counts!\nThe following code is used to plot the mean/standard deviation relationship of every gene before the transformation.\n\nlibrary(vsn)\n\n# Plot before data transformation\nmeanSdPlot(dds$counts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransform the data and then plot the mean/standard deviation relationship after the transformation.\n\n# Transform the data with a log2 transform (watch how we create a new variable for it)\nlog2dds <- cpm(dds, log=TRUE)\n\n\n# Check out the transformed values (notice how we now have floating point values and some are even negative!)\nhead(log2dds)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    BSSE_QGF_204446 \n    BSSE_QGF_204447 \n    BSSE_QGF_204448 \n    BSSE_QGF_204449 \n    BSSE_QGF_204450 \n    BSSE_QGF_204451 \n    BSSE_QGF_204452 \n    BSSE_QGF_204453 \n    BSSE_QGF_204458 \n    BSSE_QGF_204459 \n    BSSE_QGF_204460 \n    BSSE_QGF_204461 \n    BSSE_QGF_204462 \n    BSSE_QGF_204463 \n    BSSE_QGF_204464 \n    BSSE_QGF_204465 \n  \n \n\n  \n    ENSG00000182888 \n    -1.0149871 \n    -0.8276939 \n    -0.3549182 \n    -1.8514197 \n    -1.115602 \n    -1.6618073 \n    -0.8744661 \n    -1.5038016 \n    -0.2547841 \n    -1.0805284 \n    -0.8356222 \n    -1.6352550 \n    -1.0025724 \n    -1.0191401 \n    -1.0315768 \n    -0.8033451 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000286431 \n    -0.5471054 \n    -0.1931254 \n    -2.4984815 \n    -0.1680466 \n    -1.239220 \n    0.3755188 \n    -1.4534058 \n    -0.3141114 \n    -0.7014695 \n    -0.2332744 \n    -2.4120935 \n    0.3700598 \n    0.4937172 \n    0.2613948 \n    0.5415924 \n    0.9045618 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101846 \n    2.1233683 \n    1.5858211 \n    1.4484255 \n    1.4028791 \n    1.843186 \n    1.1065503 \n    0.5128935 \n    1.2788434 \n    2.1960905 \n    1.5810286 \n    1.0755162 \n    1.6037361 \n    2.8425327 \n    2.3711547 \n    2.1097388 \n    2.0027201 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000285679 \n    -2.0942552 \n    -2.5201103 \n    -0.9510723 \n    -0.7006700 \n    -3.975320 \n    -2.1045036 \n    -1.7128386 \n    -1.7807883 \n    -2.7977125 \n    -2.0224031 \n    -2.4120935 \n    -2.0665580 \n    -1.5921819 \n    -2.7227787 \n    -1.0897366 \n    -1.5028451 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101849 \n    6.2932846 \n    6.5684439 \n    5.7528313 \n    6.0670351 \n    6.313155 \n    6.7504778 \n    6.2718734 \n    6.4182406 \n    5.9469254 \n    6.2362473 \n    6.0449854 \n    6.0232538 \n    6.1471371 \n    6.5996337 \n    6.1418289 \n    6.2462658 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000047644 \n    6.7095330 \n    6.8576121 \n    6.0848036 \n    6.7826289 \n    6.851492 \n    6.7861213 \n    6.6774144 \n    6.8849740 \n    6.8038382 \n    6.7468953 \n    6.6256517 \n    6.9155029 \n    6.7548269 \n    6.9650206 \n    6.2931482 \n    6.9985429 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000004961 \n    3.8196064 \n    3.4514638 \n    4.0436716 \n    3.1400969 \n    3.981022 \n    3.5656781 \n    4.0153569 \n    3.5366299 \n    3.9137232 \n    3.5052341 \n    3.9041578 \n    3.4878931 \n    3.9178339 \n    3.6855962 \n    3.9833428 \n    3.2956981 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000005302 \n    7.0462220 \n    7.0755388 \n    5.5725868 \n    6.7473035 \n    6.839845 \n    6.9951121 \n    5.8821984 \n    6.9665842 \n    6.8417578 \n    7.0615117 \n    5.8538203 \n    7.0057387 \n    7.1513026 \n    7.1233253 \n    6.3282750 \n    7.0236595 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000101911 \n    4.7362798 \n    4.4243203 \n    5.3979519 \n    4.8293174 \n    4.468497 \n    4.1665467 \n    5.2938577 \n    4.1904009 \n    4.9056304 \n    4.5910118 \n    5.5054859 \n    4.7018879 \n    4.8114113 \n    4.4770266 \n    5.4725700 \n    4.5377748 \n  \n  \n    ENSG00000229083 \n    1.0417306 \n    -1.5995957 \n    1.8322453 \n    0.0241205 \n    0.955676 \n    0.0072169 \n    1.4054066 \n    0.7370180 \n    0.8912343 \n    0.4106746 \n    1.7146421 \n    0.7958171 \n    1.1040597 \n    -2.9421761 \n    1.7272985 \n    -0.3748886 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n# let's plot the transformed values\nmeanSdPlot(log2dds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 It is clear how genes with high mean expression values (on the right) are now comparable in terms of standard deviation to genes with lower mean expression values (on the left)."

    "section": "Data Quality Visual Assessment",
    "text": "Data Quality Visual Assessment\nOne way to understand trends in our data and the present of poor quality or outlier samples is to perform exploratory analyses through visualization. In R in general, data visualization is aided by the presence of many packages (on top the basic plotting functionality) which can handle diverse kinds of data visualization tasks (from traditional plots to visualizing tabular data through heatmaps). We will encounter two of these packages, one is ggplot2 and the other one is pheatmap.\n\nClustering\nOne of the main strategies for checking the consistency of our dataset is to cluster samples based on their complete expression profile (which as you might recall consists of 22683 genes in our dataset). This will allow us to spot the presence of outliers in the data and look for consistent profiles of gene expression across replicates, which we expect. Use the code below to plot a heatmap of normalized (and transformed) expression values for our samples. Since plotting the full expression table can be computationally expensive, we might want to subset it to the 400 top expressed genes in the dataset.\n\nlibrary(\"pheatmap\")\n\n# Take the top 200 genes in the dataset\nselect <- order(rowMeans(log2dds),\n                decreasing=TRUE)[1:400] # Select number of genes\n\n# Create another table for annotating the heatmap with colors\ndf <- as.data.frame(samples[,c(\"Donor\",\"SampleGroup\")])\n\n# Draw the heatmap using the `pheatmap` package\npheatmap(log2dds[select,], cluster_rows=FALSE, show_rownames=FALSE,\n         cluster_cols=TRUE, annotation_col=df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 What type of assessment would you make about the consistency of the samples across these top 400 genes? Do they cluster (a synonym for similar) based on the donor or on the biological condition of our interest?\n\n\n\nSample-to-sample Distances\nAnother way to get a sense of the global relationship between samples is to check for how distant samples are between themselves. This analysis of pairwise distances looks at the expression value of all 22683 genes in the dataset and determines which samples have a more or less similar or different expression value for each. We expect biologically similar samples to have very little difference.\n\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n# Compute distances\nsampleDists <- dist(t(log2dds))\n\n# Organize\nsampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists)\n\ncolors <- colorRampPalette( rev(brewer.pal(9, \"Blues\")) )(255)\n\n# Plot with `pheatmap`\npheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,\n         clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,\n         clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists,\n         color = colors,\n         annotation_col = df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Free up memory space\nrm(sampleDistMatrix)\ngc()\n\n\n💡 What type of assessment would you make about the heatmap you just produced? Which CD8 T-cell populations are mostly similar in terms of overall gene expression profile? Does a particular population stand out?\n\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nAnother useful approach for understanding the main variability axes in our data is to compute and plot a PCA. Without getting into the details, PCA takes our expression data and outputs its principal components, which encode the main sources of variability in the data. Ideally, we want the samples to have variability caused by the biological effect of our interest (in this case the differences between CD8 T-cell populations), but this might not be the case. By plotting and coloring the points by different covariates (i.e. donor or cell type) we are able to understand where the variability comes from and if there is any detectable batch effect. Use the code below to generate a scatter plot of PCA coordinates and color them to understand what causes the variability in the data.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Calculate principal components and percentage of variance\npcs <- prcomp(log2dds, scale = TRUE)\npercentVar <- round(100 * summary(pcs)$importance[2,])\npcaData <- as.data.frame(pcs$rotation) %>% merge(samples, by=0)\n\n# Plot (this time with ggplot2!!)\nggplot(pcaData, aes(PC1, PC2, color=SampleGroup, shape=Donor)) +\n  geom_point(size=3) +\n  xlab(paste0(\"PC1: \",percentVar[1],\"% variance\")) +\n  ylab(paste0(\"PC2: \",percentVar[2],\"% variance\")) + \n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 What can you say about this PCA? Are the samples positioning themselves based on the donor or their biological condition? What is the most extreme group of samples? How does this information relate to the other plots we produced above?\n\n\n# Let's clean some space up!\nrm(pcs)\nrm(pcaData)\nrm(log2dds)\ngc()\n\nNow that we have plotted all the main diagnostic information related to the dataset and we have a bit of a grasp of it, we can start thinking about testing for differentially expressed genes."

You can think of variables as ways to store objects under any given name. Let’s take the previous example and store the Hello World! character (known as a string) in a variable that we call my_variable. The creation of a variable in R is classically done through the assignment operator <-.\n\n# Let's assign the statement to a variable (nothing happens when running this code)\nmy_variable <- \"Hello World!\"\n\n# Let's display the content of the new variable!\nprint(my_variable)\n\n[1] \"Hello World!\"\n\n\n\n💡 What happened in the top right part of your screen when you ran the code lines above?

Think of data.frames as the R equivalent of Excel spreadsheets, so a way to store tabular data. As we will see later, pretty much all the data we are going to handle will be in the form of a data.frame or some of its other variations.\n\n# Let's create and display a data frame (a table) with four rows and two columns\ndata.frame(\"Class\"=c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"), # First column\n            \"Quantity\"=c(1,10,4,6)) # Second column\n\n  Class Quantity\n1     a        1\n2     b       10\n3     c        4\n4     d        6\n\n\nYou have now instructed R to do something for you!

Some of the QC metrics of interest to consider include the ones listed below, on the left are optimal metric profiles while on the right are sub-optimal ones:\n\nPer-base Sequence Quality  This uses box plots to highlight the per-base quality along all reads in the sequencing experiment, we can notice a physiological drop in quality towards the end part of the read.\n\n\nPer-sequence Quality Scores  Here we are plotting the distribution of Phred scores across all identified sequences, we can see that the high quality experiment (left) has a peak at higher Phred scores values (34-38).\n\n\nPer-base Sequence Content  Here we check the sequence (read) base content, in a normal scenario we do not expect any dramatic variation across the full length of the read since we should see a quasi-balanced distribution of bases.\n\n\nPer-sequence GC Content  GC-content referes to the degree at which guanosine and cytosine are present within a sequence, in NGS experiments which also include PCR amplification this aspect is crucial to check since GC-poor sequences may be enriched due to their easier amplification bias. In a normal random library we would expect this to have a bell-shaped distribution such as the one on the left.\n\n\nSequence Duplication Levels  This plot shows the degree of sequence duplication levels. In a normal library (left) we expect to have low levels of duplication which can be a positive indicator of high sequencing coverage.\n\n\nAdapter Content  In NGS experiments we use adapters to create a library. Sometimes these can get sequenced accidentally and end up being part of a read. This phenomenon can be spotted here and corrected later using a computational approach called adapter trimming, visible in next section’s figure."

    "text": "Counting Transcripts\nAfter sequences have been aligned to their respective place on the genome, it is time to actually count how many times a given sequence is found on any given gene (or transcripts, or exons or others..), this will actually be our gene expression measurement!\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to achieve this task but among the most used is the featureCounts tool. In the end, for every sample, we will end up with a number for each gene (or transcripts), these are called gene (transcript) counts.\nThese are usually summarized in a table, called gene expression table, where each sample is a column and each row a different gene. We will now load one and take a closer look, this will be our starting point in the hands-on analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.\n\n💡 What is the difference between a gene and a transcript?"

The original data supporting the findings of the study has been deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data portal under accession number GSE120575. This is the place where all studies publish the processed sequencing data from their analysis in order for other researchers to download it and reproduce their findings or test their own hypotheses.\nWe have already downloaded the data and inserted it in a Google Drive folder organizing it as follows:\n\nraw_counts.csv: the gene by sample matrix containing the number of times each gene is detected in each sample (our gene expression values)\nsamples_info.csv: the table containing samples information, known as metadata, which tells us about the biological meaning of each sample\n\nOpen the folder through your Google Drive (this step is important), check the presence of the files in the browser and then only AFTER having done this, run the code below. After having opened the Google Drive folder, follow the code chunk below where we are going to load the data and create two new variables in our R session, one for each table.\n\n🚨 NOTE: After you run the code below, look into your R console and check if you are prompted to insert your Google account information.

This is a file format where columns are separated by commas. You might be familiar with this format if you have worked quite a bit in Excel. In R, we can save tabular data with the write.table() function specifying the location (the file name) we want. This is useful in the case our R session dies or we decide to interrupt it. In this case we will not have to run the whole analysis from the beginning and we can just source the file and load it!\n\nwrite.table(samples, \"samples_table.csv\", sep = \",\", quote = FALSE)\n\nWe can load the object back into the current session by using the following code line:\n\nsamples <- read.table(\"samples_table.csv\", sep = \",\")\n\n\n💡 We will also repeat this procedure with the results of the differential expression analysis in order to avoid repeating work we have already done in case of any trouble!\n\nNow that we have our objects correctly loaded, we can dive into the actual RNA-seq analysis."
