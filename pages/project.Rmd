## Group Project Time! üöÄ
It's time to see how much you can take away from the concepts and the topics of the course! You are going to be working on **designing and constructing your own project**!

## How does it work?
You will have 5 minutes to organize into groups of approximately the same size, after that you will:

1. Reflect on the Bachelor's thesis project among the ones in your group

2. Select one project that in your opinion would **benefit the most from a bulk RNA-Seq experiment**

3. Design your planned experiment by considering the following **key points**:
    
    - What is your biological question or **hypothesis**?
    - What **experimental conditions** are required to test your hypothesis?
    - How many biological/technical **replicates** are necessary for obtaining reliable results?
    - Is your experiment well-designed, or are there potential **confounding factors**?
    - What type of RNA **enrichment method** should you use?
    - Based on the RNA type you want to analyze (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, etc.), do you need a stranded library preparation?
    - What **read length**, **sequencing depth**, and **sequencing mode** are required for your analysis?
    - If a bioinformatician will perform the analysis of your samples, what **metadata** should you provide to ensure a well-informed and accurate analysis?
    - Do you believe incorporating the analysis of **other -OMICS** will enhance your experiment? If yes, which ones?

4. Create a 1-2 slides presentation to communicate how you would go about planning your project! (_remember_: you are trying to convince your boss to spend a lot of üí∏)

5. Present your work! (nice and easy ü§ôüèº)
